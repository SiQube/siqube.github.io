I'm a PhD student at the [Universit채t Potsdam](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/) within the [AEye group](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/cs-ml/aeye). The AEye group is located within the institute of [Computer Science](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/cs/ifi/welcome) and part of the [Machine Learning group](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/cs-ml/index). Before I joined the Universit채t Potsdam, I obtained my bachelor and masters degree in  mathematics with a focus on geometry from the [Freie Universit채t Berlin](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/math/index.html) und [Technische Universit채t Berlin](https://www.tu-berlin.de/?9003), respectively.

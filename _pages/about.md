Hey, my name is David and I like eye tracking, machine learning, NLP, and geometry. I'm a PhD student under the supervision of [Lena A. Jäger](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/de/people/team/digital-linguistics/jaeger.html) and [Paul Prasse](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/cs-ml/staff/phd/prasse) in the [AEye group](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/cs-ml/aeye) at [UP](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/) and [Digital Linguistics Group](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/en/digital-linguistics/aboutus.html) at [UZH](https://www.uzh.ch/de.html). The AEye group is located within the institute of [Computer Science](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/cs/ifi/welcome) and part of the [Machine Learning group](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/cs-ml/index). Before I joined UP, I obtained my bachelor and masters degree in  mathematics with a focus on geometry from [FU Berlin](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/math/index.html) and [TU Berlin](https://www.tu-berlin.de/?9003), respectively. My Erdös number is 5.
